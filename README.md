# Object Detection and Speed Calculation using YOLOv8

This repository contains code for detecting objects and calculating their speed using the YOLOv8 model from Ultralytics.

## Files

- **tracker.py**: This file contains code for initializing the object tracker.
- **speed.py**: This file contains code for calculating the speed of detected objects.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   https://github.com/a-4anand/seminar.git


2. Install the required dependencies:


3. Download the pre-trained YOLOv5 model weights from the [official Ultralytics repository](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5) and place them in the `weights` directory.

4. Run the object detection and speed calculation script:


Replace `v4.mp4` with the path to your input video and `output.avi` with the desired output filename.
